This program is essentially simplified notes.
From a usage perspective: the notes are aimed at simplicity of use and removal of unnecessary functions.

The program has 2 functions that allow you to store information:
- Creating topics, which are somewhat similar to a regular folder, in which you can store other objects and folders;
- Creating notes in which you can write down information.
Together, these 2 small functions provide the ability to organize information well, dividing it into topics and subtopics.
The user has the ability to organize information placement, management, and search well.
There is an option to change the app's theme to dark or light, depending on the user's preference.
A pleasant interface is made to make it easy for the user to navigate.

SQLite is used to store information.
Search bar, changing the app's theme, widget behavior, displaying information on the screen, and much more - were written from scratch.
It's important to note: the program may not be suitable for all devices ( at least from the perspective of UI and element placement on the screen ).

A bit of personal context:
I developed this program specifically for a girl ( whom I once liked ), so I wanted to do a good job.
There was also a goal to learn in the process: how to use SQL, how to design.
The program lacks microservice architecture ( I haven't studied this topic yet ) and overall everything is done at a fairly low level ( in my opinion ).
I just wanted to test my capabilities...
